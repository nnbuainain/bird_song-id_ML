# Testing ML and DP to Identify birds by song

<p align="center"> <img src=image_bird.png width="100" alt="INPA 

## Goals
In this project me and Maura Costa (@Mauraregina) used different machine learning methods including supervised and non-supervised algorithms to try to distinguish birds that are genetically differentiated by their songs.

## Tools
sklearn, keras, autokeras, autosklearn and few other algorithms.

** Output models can be found in the "models" directory, except for the automated deeplearning results which are in "structure_data_classifier"
